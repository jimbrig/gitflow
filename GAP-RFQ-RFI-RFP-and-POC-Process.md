## RFI RFP RFQ
**Functional consultants:**

If you have an RFI/RFP/RFQ, go to the support room and check with the people of the presales team on duty that day if they are available for you ticket. If they are not immediately available you can arrange a later time that day. 

You can also make a meeting for a later date, with one of the people on duty that day.

The functional and technical consultants do the analysis together. Do not simply leave technical consultants alone. 

During home working use conference calls to do the analysis together.

Please remember this kind of Presales is not billable. We must avoid time loss as much as possible so be sure to have all the infos.



## GAP
**Functional and technical consultant:**

Follow the same process as for RFI/RFP/RFQ. The difference is that GAP are billable and usually have more details. The analysis should be more precise than for RFI/RFP/RFQ. Do not necessarly write a technical analysis for each point. If you have to do research for the point you are analyzing, mark those information and any other relevant information regarding this point in the Technical comments section.


## Estimations and analysis
**Technical consultant:**

Do the analysis in the same was as for presales. Estimations on GAP and RFI/RFP/RFQ are given in days, 0.5 day being the minimum increment.

Always account for the fact that you have very little information and so you should allow for a good margin in your estimations. Imagine the maximum time that would be needed for the worst case scenario, while still remaining reasonable regarding the point your are analyzing. Don't hesitate to challenge the point when the cost outweighs the added value.

## POC
**Functional consultant:**

If you decide you need to make a POC for your customer, simply create a task for each functionality. They will be analysed by the technical consultant who did the GAP.
