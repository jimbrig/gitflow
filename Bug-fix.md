### Bugfix
Maintenance only takes care of issues related to a bug linked to a dev we made AND for customers who pays maintenance fees. 

Not sure it's linked to a dev? Create a ticket in Help. It will be redirected if necessary.  
The customer doesn't pay maintenance fee? Create a ticket in Saas Customisation. 

+ Create a **task in Ps maintenance stage New**
  + Star if urgent
  + Put yourself as reviewer
  + Be complete : detailed steps, version number, customer, database, credentials if required, existing customisations
  + DO NOT complete Sales Order Item and Parent Task ($$)
  + The more precise you are, the quicker we'll fix the bug


###### FAQ
+ **Can you help me fix my Studio view?** 
  + No. Either create a task in Help (for deactivating the view) or Saas Customisations (for adapting the view to your customer's need).
