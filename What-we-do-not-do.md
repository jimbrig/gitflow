## Integration and code review of third party apps of functionalities already offered by Odoo

Odoo has a lot of existing apps, and therefore we do not accept all integrations and code review.

For now we do not do integrations and code review of third party apps for:

* Website: Odoo has its own web-shop, so anything like integration with Magento, Prestashop, etc. will not be accepted by Odoo anymore, unless the feature is not available on Odoo. They can turn to a partner for these requests. Payment acquirers are still accepted as Odoo doesn't have payment acquirers (Ingenico, Stripes, etc are not Odoo)

* Accounting: Odoo has a very powerful accounting solution, so no more integrations and app review for accounting either, unless the feature is not supported by Odoo. We will still do file exports development for customers who want to import in their accounting, but no direct integration. Again they can turn to a partner
