This is the MOST IMPORTANT part.

Customer don’t want new feature, they want to solve a business issue.

We need to understand that problem and why solving it will bring added value to them.

Don’t challenge the content:

* challenge when you don’t have the information
* challenge when the added value is too low compare to the cost
