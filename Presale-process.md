## Functional consultant
If you have a presales ticket, go to the support room and check with the people of the presales team on duty that day if they are available for you ticket. If they are not immediately available you can arrange a later time that day. It's a first come first serve basis.

The functional and technical consultants do the analysis together. Do not simply ping technical consultants and expect your task to be done, you cannot anticipate the work load of the people at presales that day. Also do not leave the technical consultant to finish the task by himself, unless he explicitly tells you he has all the elements he needs to complete the task, this is a team effort.

During home working use conference calls to do the analysis together.

The functional consultant is responsible to have all the functional information for the task. Do not ask functional questions to the technical consultant, if you are not sure ask your bunch leader or colleagues and then get back to the technical consultant.

Please remember Presales is not billable. We must avoid time loss as much as possible so be sure to have all the infos.

## Technical consultant
Mark yourself as reviewer on the task.

Make sure you have all the infos you need to give correct estimate.

Do not make a full estimation as for saas custo, it should be a wider estimation.

Remember when requests are in presales they are usually poorly detailed. Once they become a SaaS custo, new information might come to light and make the development heavier. So don't hesitate to add a little margin to your estimation to take this into account. Like this we avoid tasks doubling in estimation time when going from presales to saas custo.
