This page is intended for the presales team of PS Tech. It describes the way to handle presales requests

### Mission
* Analyse Saas Custo tasks
* Analyse Presales tasks
* Analyse GAP/RFQ/RFP/RFI 
* Answer technical questions of functional consultants
* Resolve bugs for customers who don't pay maintenance fees

For Saas Custo tasks, go in the pipe and treat them in the order they arrived in this stage. For all other requests, the functional consultants will contact you. You do not need to go look by yourself for any other tasks than Saas Custo. 

Our days are limited. Try to organise yourself with the requests you get. If you are busy when getting a request, simply make an appointment with he consultant for later in the day. Use your calendar as it allows you to have a good vision on how your day will be organised.

### Analyse Saas Custo tasks

1. Open the project page for [Ps - Dubai Saas Customisation](https://www.odoo.com/web#action=333&active_id=2828&model=project.task&view_type=kanban&cids=14&menu_id=4720)
2. Switch to list (tree) view
3. Use the filter called **Tasks to analyse**. If you want to create your own filter, simply make a search for pipe **Analysis**, reviewer=odoobot or reviewer is not set
4. Sort the rows by _Last stage update_,
5. Pick the tasks from the oldest to the newest
6. Put yourself immediately as reviewer so that no one else works on the same task
7. Do the analysis following the standard [process](Saas process) 
8. Timesheet on the task

### Analyse Presales tasks
The functional consultant will contact you. Do the task with them and timesheet on the the presales task.

Follow the [process](Presale process) here.

### Analyse GAP/RFQ/RFP/RFI 
The functional consultant will contact you. He will provide the document where you must put your estimation.

Typically you will have an excel file with one development request per line. You have a column to put your estimation in days, and usually one for technical remarks.

Follow the [process](GAP-RFQ-RFI-RFP-and-POC-Process) here.

### Answer technical questions of functional consultants
When a consultant has a technical question follow these steps:
1. Ask if the customer has a pack. You can check that yourself in Odoo
2. If he has a pack, warn the functional consultant that your work will be timesheeted on the pack. Remind him/her that there is a free service called Help in case they have in issue with the timesheeting
3. If he doesn't have a pack this will be timesheeted as presales. Create a task in the presales project.
4. Follow the [process](PS-Technical-Issues-Process) here.

### Resolve bugs for customers who don't pay maintenance fees
When a consultant contacts you for a bug fix, make sure the customer doesn't pay maintenance fees. If they do pay, the task should go to the [maintenance team](Maintenance)

The work done will be timesheeted on the customer pack.

Follow the [process](PS-maintenance-Process) here.
