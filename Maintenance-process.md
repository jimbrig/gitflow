### For functional consultants
If you have a bug for a customer that doesn't pay maintenance follow these steps:
1. create a ticket in Saas Custo project. Make sure to complete everything necessary: customer, parent task, Sales Order Item, subscription
2. put it in stage _Planning_
3. check the box _No Maintenance Cost_ in _Extra info_
4. Describe the error, explain how to reproduce it
5. the technical consultant that processes it will assign himself. Don't assign him
6. Go to the support room and and check with the people of the presales team on duty that day if they are available for you ticket. If they are not immediately available you can arrange a later time that day. It's a first come first serve basis.
7. If no one was available you can plan it with someone on duty the next day

### For technical consultants
If you have to process this kind of tickets :
1. make sure all the information are on the task
    * customer
    * parent task
    * sale order item
    * subscription
    * regular infos we expect on any tasks (platform, version, db, etc.)
    * description of the issue, way to reproduce it
2. assign yourself
3. Timesheet directly on the task

In case you have too much to do that day, don't assign yourself on the ticket. Only exception is for emergencies. Emergencies are hard to define except when someone's life is at stake. Most of the time an emergency is when a bug is preventing the customer from working (ex: crashed database, traceback on basic operations for the customer, etc.)
